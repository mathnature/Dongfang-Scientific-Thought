            <h2>Dongfang Scientific Thought</h2>
            <p>Editorial Board of Mathematics and Nature</p>
            
            <div class="intro-text">
                <p class="justified-text">A group of specters, dressed in eerie gray veils and embroidered with the symbol of "scientific consensus", block the light of the sun and moon, a bit creepy, a bit evil, wandering in the sky above the earth, from west to east, from east to west. A disabled shrike hunts down newly born young creatures around, skillfully impaling its prey on thorns to pierce their innards, all while emitting shrill, flattering laughter, proclaiming to all beings beneath the clouds its privilege and prestige to roam the skies unchecked.</p>
                <p class="justified-text">Today, the shadow of specters tightly envelops the spirit of science. The grey veil obscures the true appearance of their true forms, and a gloomy voice pours down from the edge of the veil, rising one after another between heaven and earth: "I am the consensus, saving all living beings, indifferent to fame and gain, and all the seeds and fruits of the world need to be sacrificed to heaven; Those who violate orders and go against the tide to sow blessings are heretics, doomed to fall into eternal darkness."  TThe specters patrol the skies and traverse the earth, capturing new scientific ideas, wielding the invisible sword of stigmatization, and stab the hearts of the most hardworking and weak cultivators in an attempt to make them no longer sound.  High halls and spacious buildings, singing and dancing, day and night revelry, all for the success of repeated plundering and the joy of stifling new life. They are not shrikes, yet they are more vicious than shrikes.</p>
	<p class="justified-text">Wake up, great scientific thought, give up the unrealistic fantasy that forbearance will eventually influence specters, and return to nature. Let the strong wind sow seeds, let the rain and dew nourish life, and take root and sprout in the wilderness, on river banks, on lakesides, in the mountains, in deep streams, and on cliffs. The brilliant sunshine always shines on the earth, and the power of life is unstoppable.</p>

                         <div class="justified-text">Scientific logic has the powerful spiritual force and serves as the fundamental guarantee for the progress of human civilization. Theoretical systems and experimental engineering exhibit different positive and negative values, which establish a number of programmatic provisions guiding scientific development and constitute the normative standards jointly followed by the international scientific community.</div>
                        	<div class="justified-text">   <h4>Article 1</h4> Logical consistency and self-discipline are the fundamental principles that must be observed in the establishment of scientific theories and the advancement of experimental engineering. </div>
                         	<div class="justified-text">   <h4>Article 2</h4> Both the partial and overall logic of scientific theory conform to the unitary principle and the logical entropy principle. Logical deductions that violate the unitary principle yield uncertain conclusions, originate from malformed definitions, untrue assumptions, or ambiguous models, and hold negative value. Logical deductions involving logical entropy change may produce logical loopholes and require rectification; the logical attributes in the deduction of conceptual-drift logical entropy change undergo fundamental change, determine distorted causal relationships, and hold the negative value. </div>
                         	<div class="justified-text">   <h4>Article 3</h4> The experimental principle, data observation or data production, and interpretation of experimental phenomena, in both partial and overall aspects, conform to the unitary principle and the logical entropy principle. Modifications to observed data, fabrication of experimental data, or distorted interpretations of experimental phenomena that violate the unitary principle or the logical entropy principle do not constitute valid evidence for deductions and conclusions that deviate from basic common sense, and hold the negative value. To overturn untrue premises and distorted experimental reports, to subvert and halt negative-value experimental engineering, is an irresistible inherent demand of scientific development, bearing profound scientific significance. </div>
                         	<div class="justified-text">   <h4>Article 4</h4> The rationality of logic is not defined by the technique of conceptual confusion that minority approval is packaged into scientific consensus by high-impact media, but must be validated through extensive historical practice. The priority of logical self-consistency is higher than the clamorous claims that distort scientific concepts. </div>
                         	<div class="justified-text">   <h4>Article 5</h4> Unique scientific discoveries by researchers from disadvantaged groups, disseminated worldwide through independent websites, journals, self-publishing, free science forums and other media tools, accept public testing, break through systemic suppression, and are legitimate and valid. </div>

                <h2>Tortuous Course of Com Quantum Theory</h2>
            </div>
            
            <div class="intro-text">
                <p class="justified-text">Unifying macroscopic and microscopic theories is a dream pursuit for theoretical physicists worldwide. Achieving this great cause efficiently requires mutual assistance and cooperation, not violence and struggle.</p>
               <p class="justified-text">On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival in 1975, in a remote village deep in the Dabie Mountains, an old man with a northern accent sat under the old locust tree at the village entrance, recounting his personal experiences to the children gathered around him.</p>
               <p class="justified-text">"It is unbearable to look back upon, yet it must never be forgotten... The invaders were exceptionally cruel and inhuman, and their atrocities were beyond description. There was a traitor in the village whom everyone loathed, wishing they could tear him to pieces. That traitor had rat-like eyes. He was educated, held a diploma, and spoke foreign languages. He had originally worked in the city with his parents, but he ran back alone to the old family home in the village, where he attempted to forcibly take away a young girl. The girl was fifteen that year, graceful, beautiful, and quiet. Her father had gone to the front lines years earlier to resist the invaders and had sacrificed his life. Her mother was a decent woman. It wasn't that she disliked the man's appearance, but because he had been morally corrupt since childhood, she firmly refused, and the girl herself hated him very much. The villagers all called him "Rat Eye." Rat Eye, enraged and humiliated, spewed filthy language: 'You two women are nothing but frogs at the bottom of a well, self-righteous and narcissistic. Think you are fragrant, do you? Without the Imperial Army's certification, it's false fragrance! False fragrance stinks to the high heaven!' After Rat Eye left, the village was quiet for over ten days. Unexpectedly, on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, two invaders' vehicles suddenly entered the village. Dozens of invasion soldiers, carrying knives and rifles, conducted a looting. The villagers watched helplessly as everything was robbed clean. After the looting ended, the invaders rushed into the girl's home like mad dogs. The small courtyard immediately filled with chirping howls. Soon after, the heart-wrenching cries of the mother and daughter were heard. A neighbor recognized Rat Eye's voice; he was speaking a foreign language, but his voice was unchanged. The pack of beastly invaders gang-raped the mother and daughter. During the struggle, the girl bit off one invader's ear. The invaders immediately bayoneted the girl and her mother to death. An old man at the village entrance recognized Rat Eye's figure; that night he wore black glasses and had his collar turned up extremely high, covering most of his face. Rat Eye committed countless evils, yet faced no heavenly retribution. Near the end of the Liberation War, he fled with his entire family to Taiwan."</p>
                <p class="justified-text">The bloodstains of history are not yet dry, yet the same betrayal, in the name of science, is being staged once more within the halls of academia. The question of how many Rat Eyes cloaked in scientific guise have long occupied crucial positions while lacking substantive scientific contributions constitutes a problem worthy of systematic reflection. However, for those holding high academic offices, if they have not only failed to achieve anything that advances science but have instead devoted themselves to suppressing, strangling, spreading rumors, slandering, stigmatizing, and even attempting to harm groundbreaking scientific discoveries and their discoverers, such conduct undoubtedly represents a prolonged departure from the scientific spirit and academic ethics.</p>
                <p class="justified-text">The Com Quantum Theory, which unifies macroscopic and microscopic quantum phenomena, was born in China. Its core principles were first proposed by Dongfang in May 1986. Although the precise equations required to describe different macroscopic systems vary, this research was shelved for a long time after key mathematical derivations were completed, due to a lack of authoritative experimental data on macroscopic quantization. It was not until February 11, 2016, when the LIGO collaboration released detailed observational data of the GW150914 gravitational wave event, that Dongfang conducted systematic simulations and comparisons based on different Com Quantum Theory models, ultimately revealing the precise quantization laws governing the frequency distribution and dynamic evolution of the gravitational wave signal. The quantization equations in the paper attracted widespread interest from the international academic community, but the core principles of Com Quantum Theory remain unpublished. After the original equations for binary star merger frequency calculations were plagiarized, misinterpreted, and misapplied in a paper published in a renowned international journal, arXiv decided to publish Dongfang original manuscript. Years later, despite repeated invitations from prestigious journals such as Nature Physics and The Astrophysical Journal, no expected response has been received from Dongfang. Years later, both Nature Physics and The Astrophysical Journal solicited a manuscript from Dongfang, but he refused to provide the expected response.</p>
                <p class="justified-text">In 2016, Europe launched the Quantum Technology Flagship, but failed to successfully decipher the quantization laws of LIGO’s GW150914 signal wave. In 2019, Google announced the achievement of "quantum supremacy," but failed to make the due substantive breakthroughs in revealing the mathematical essence of quantum mechanics. Although it would take only one year to construct the complete mathematical framework of Com Quantum Theory, as a researcher from a vulnerable group, Dongfang decided to postpone organizing the main results of Com Quantum Theory, leaving ten years for the mainstream scientific community to gain priority in unified quantum theory research. Considering that arXiv.org had once transferred the submission ID originally belonging to Dongfang ’s first submitted paper to subsequent researchers, and that China’s preprint service system either invited submissions first and then closed the account or arbitrarily altered paper authorship information, Dongfang decided to completely abandon the inefficient and motivationally opaque traditional academic journals and arXiv.org, and began using the independent journal Mathematics & Nature to efficiently publish groundbreaking series of research results in mathematics and theoretical physics. In 2019, a domestic researcher colluded with a retired Italian professor to frame Dongfang , resulting in the deletion of his ResearchGate academic account along with the foundational paper of Com Quantum Theory. In 2020, Dongfang re-registered a ResearchGate account and successively published dozens of original mathematics and physics papers, but due to an irreparable hard disk failure, the foundational paper of Com Quantum Theory could not be recovered. In 2021, Dongfang publicly declared that the systematic writing and publication plan for Com Quantum Theory would be launched in 2028. In 2025, Europe launched another quantum strategy, explicitly planning to make Europe the "global quantum technology leader" by 2030. Dongfang decided to further postpone the launch of systematic research on Com Quantum Theory from 2030 to 2038, hoping that the European quantum strategy would achieve a breakthrough in unified quantum theory first, thereby providing the global scientific community with more ample space for development.</p>
                <p class="justified-text">Any fundamental breakthrough in the history of science derives its value from complete logical self-consistency and a predictive power that transcends its time. A truly insightful original manuscript, even if temporarily obscured, ought to be recognized for its worth through purely logical review by peers with academic conscience and discernment. Yet it is lamentable that such exceptional judgment is astonishingly absent in today's mainstream mathematical and physical sciences community in China, revealing the truth behind nearly all its large-scale research endeavors. The contrast is deeply ironic: academic establishments in Europe and America, which hold traditional discursive authority in mathematics and physics, have never accused Com Quantum Theory or its founder of "pseudoscience" or "academic misconduct." The most intense and norm-violating systematic stigmatization has originated precisely within the theory's native land. Certain power-holders within academia, along with a minority of artificial intelligence systems and search engines, on the grounds that renowned European and American journals have not published Dongfang's papers, have engaged in frenzied rumor-mongering and slander against his vast body of groundbreaking research. They surreptitiously attach stigmatizing labels such as "false," "harmful," "violent," and "pornographic" to mislead young readers. This constitutes nothing less than blatant hostility toward the scientific spirit. This encirclement and suppression has long transcended the scope of academic debate, evolving into an organized persecution. Between 2021 and 2022, platforms like Zhihu launched sustained campaigns of online violence, with tactics escalating from anonymous defamation to public personal attacks. Behind-the-scenes forces further colluded with unethical leaders within his workplace, attempting to orchestrate a tragedy to eliminate the theory's founder both physically and spiritually. After this conspiracy was thwarted, in 2024, forces shifted their battlefield to international academic forums, anonymously setting sinister traps and goading him into attending conferences. However, their true motives were fully discerned, and the plot failed. All of this profoundly reveals the creed deeply rooted at the core of academic power: "With authority in hand, there is no need for innovation; but if you dare to innovate, the achievement must belong to me. Otherwise, I possess the means to make you vanish without a trace." This set of unwritten rules permeates the system from the top down: students' original ideas are appropriated by their supervisors; teachers' achievements are plundered by administrators. Even more egregiously, secondary school principals devoid of any academic merit have forcibly ordered teachers to suspend classes to write books for them, publishing trash at public expense. This kind of behavior systematically corrupts the nation's great creative power and the very foundation of its innovation.</p>
	<p class="justified-text">The international scientific community's disregard for the successful application of Com Quantum Theory's inferences to renowned data analyses is disingenuous, while the systemic suppression, strangulation, rumor-mongering, defamation, and framing of its founder by the mainstream scientific establishment in its native land is real. The tide of history has never been stoppable; Com Quantum Theory will ultimately unleash its tremendous scientific energy.</p>

                    <h3>A Civilizational Relay Connecting Past and Future</h3>
                    <p class="justified-text">Europe pioneered the mathematical system and the classical paradigm of natural science, establishing the irreplaceable systemic meta-rules of modern civilization. From the rigorous axiomatic system of Euclid's Elements to the edifice of classical mechanics constructed in Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy; from the independent creation of calculus by Leibniz and Newton, which ushered in the era of mathematical analysis, to Faraday's revelation of the law of electromagnetic induction through intuitive experimentation, Europe's scientific pioneers laid a solid rational foundation and scientific paradigm for human civilization through systematic theoretical construction and experimental exploration. Particularly Faraday, this bookbinding apprentice of humble origins with almost no formal education, yet with extraordinary intuition and simple experiments, insightfully uncovered nature's deeply hidden electromagnetic mysteries. His discoveries not only directly led the electrical revolution but also became the cornerstone of modern electrical civilization and technological application. His scientific spirit continues to inspire countless explorers today, demonstrating the enduring value of theory and practice.</p>

                    <h3>Diverse and Complementary Scientific Paradigms</h3>
                    <p class="justified-text">The United States' outstanding achievements in applied science and technological innovation demonstrate the immense energy released by the integration of scientific practice and theory. From the Wright brothers' first powered flight to the lunar landing feat of the Apollo program, and from the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs to the birth of the Internet, the U.S. has consistently stood at the forefront of technological revolution. The rise of Silicon Valley has not only reshaped the global industrial landscape but also spurred a new wave of technological advancement represented by information technology, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. NASA's deep space exploration, SpaceX's breakthroughs in commercial spaceflight, alongside fundamental contributions by numerous scientists in physics, chemistry, and medicine, together form a magnificent picture of the American science and engineering system. These accomplishments stem not only from substantial R&D investment and an innovative culture but also benefit from an open research ecosystem, rooted in its native soil, that encourages academic freedom and collaboration among elites, providing continuous momentum and paradigmatic reference for global scientific and technological progress.

                    <h3>The Epochal Contribution of Eastern Wisdom</h3>
                    <p class="justified-text">The Eastern world began relatively late in constructing the framework of modern science. In fundamental disciplines such as mathematics and physics, the mainstream focus remains on learning, digesting, and extending Western-established theoretical systems, while the mainstream academic community maintains a stance of systematic suppression and destruction toward any non-self-originated, groundbreaking new principles and theories. However, in the technological domain, China has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in recent years across various applied fields including aerospace, communications, and new energy, demonstrating formidable engineering implementation and integrated innovation capabilities. Against this backdrop, the scientific framework of Dongfang is dedicated to building a bridge connecting Eastern and Western scientific cognition. The Unitary Principle, the Logical Entropy Principle, Dongfang Angular Motion Law, and the Entangled Spherical Harmonic Function, among others, with their profound logical rigor and mathematical elegance, provide a new paradigm for understanding the unity of complex systems and information evolution. These contributions are expected to exert a far-reaching influence on the development of mathematics, fundamental sciences, and future social sciences, thereby promoting a more inclusive and dialogical process of scientific civilization.</p>

            <div class="declaration-text">
                <h4>Declaration of Dongfang Science</h4>
	<p class="justified-text">A thought, a thought born from the fertile soil of the East, a thought that shines in mutual brilliance with Western scientific civilization, is striding over countless obstacles, marching forward with its head high, steadily advancing across the world, conveying a spirit of profound and tenacious power.</p>
	<p class="justified-text">Dongfang Scientific Thought, integrating the natural code of the Unitary Principle and the Logical Entropy Principle, the entanglement spherical harmonic functions that revolutionize scientific cognition, the elementary algebra that systematically conquers Diophantine equations and Fermat's Last Theorem, and the Com Quantum Theory that unifies macro and micro quantum phenomena, has achieved a meta-breakthrough in the scientific paradigm. Where its edge is directed, complex problems are often resolved with ease; where its spirit reaches, no true scholar wishes to see it extinguished, no righteous path tolerates its defilement, and no shackles can confine its radiance. Dongfang Scientific Thought is dedicated to resolving the fundamental paradoxes and cognitive bottlenecks in modern basic science, providing a new mathematical and physical foundation for understanding the laws of nature. It is far from piecemeal amendments to existing theories, but rather a comprehensive reconstruction of the scientific cognitive system. Science, as the common intellectual heritage of humanity, should not be monopolized by any specific group or ideology. It must return to the essence of nature, explore the true laws of the universe, and promote the sustainable development of Earth's advanced civilization. The mission of Dongfang Science lies in breaking the unintentionally formed latent monopolies and promoting the diversified evolution of scientific theories. True science transcends national boundaries, and the exploration of truth relies on the collaboration of global wisdom. Dongfang Science consciously shoulders the responsibility of being a civilizational bridge, continuously infusing rational and open majestic force into the progress of human science and the dialogue between civilizations.</p>
	<p class="justified-text">The establishment of scientific theories, the conduct of scientific experiments, the implementation of scientific practices, and the overall development of the scientific enterprise must be guided by a scientific methodology based on rigorous logic and bound by the same code of rationality. We pay tribute to all great scientific achievements in history, while firmly opposing ideological dogma and academic authoritarianism, and resolutely resisting scientific fraud and resource abuse that deviate from logical foundations. The new scientific norms established by the Dongfang Science Charter mark the awakening of the scientific enterprise from the project frenzy driven by the pursuit of fame and gain, returning it to its sacred mission of serving the progress of human civilization. This ensures that genuine natural laws guide the direction of scientific research, enabling science to become, on a purified path, the fundamental force that perpetually drives the healthy development of Earth's advanced civilization. Upholding a rigorous logical framework, an open academic mind, and righteous conviction, Dongfang Scientific Thought shoulders this historical mission and strives to advance the cause of human science toward a more mature, wiser, and more sustainable form of civilization. Building an open and inclusive ecosystem for scientific exchange, widely embracing the correct discoveries of groundbreaking explorations by researchers from diverse backgrounds, is the vibrant practice of this very mission. In the future, both natural sciences and even social sciences will, through the integration of the irreplaceable new paradigm provided by Dongfang Scientific Thought, achieve a civilizational-level cognitive leap.</p>
	<p class="justified-text">The path of truth is long, and our quest is unceasing. We shall reshape the foundation of science with the laws of nature, and open a new chapter of civilization with open wisdom. Great scientific discoveries never gain or lose their brilliance because of the discoverer's identity or background; true scientific exploration never sets sail for the purpose of seizing personal or collective fame and gain. All great truths, like the vast starry sky, will ultimately transcend all narrow private desires and suppressions, shining with eternal radiance.</p>
	<p class="justified-text">Our common dream must come true! Our common dream will definitely come true!</p>
